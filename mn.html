    <h4 style="color: #0d763c;">
        The Merchant Navy refers to a fleet of commercial ships that transport goods and passengers across the world's oceans and seas. Unlike naval forces, the merchant navy is primarily focused on trade and commerce, playing a critical role in global transportation and logistics. It includes cargo ships, oil tankers, container ships, and passenger liners. Careers in the merchant navy involve working as deck officers, engineers, and ratings on these vessels, with opportunities to travel internationally. The profession offers roles in navigation, ship maintenance, logistics, and safety, with the potential for a rewarding career that combines technical expertise with global travel.</h4>
