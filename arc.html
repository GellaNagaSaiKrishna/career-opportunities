    <h1 style="color: #051e9c;">What is Architecture?</h1>
    <h4 style="color: #0d763c;">Architecture is the art and science of designing and constructing buildings and other physical structures. It involves creating functional, aesthetically pleasing, and sustainable environments for people to live, work, and interact in. Architects combine creativity with technical knowledge to design spaces that are safe, efficient, and aligned with the needs of their users. The field of architecture encompasses residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, as well as urban planning, landscape design, and preservation of historic structures. It integrates elements of engineering, art, and environmental science to solve complex design challenges while considering factors like materials, safety, and environmental impact.</h4>
